# Climate Temperature Prediction

This project uses machine learning models and time series to predict the average temperature based on environmental features like humidity, CO2 concentration, and solar irradiance.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marikinyo/Climate-Change.git
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Results
The project compares multiple machine learning models for temperature prediction, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **ARIMA for temperature prediction**
