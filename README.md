Climate Temperature Prediction

This project uses machine learning models and time series to predict the average temperature based on environmental features like humidity, CO2 concentration, and solar irradiance.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Marikinyo/Climate-Change.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Results
The project compares multiple machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and ARIMA for temperature prediction.
